## Germany

### S-Naive Model










### ETS Model 

Visualizing Germany again -> looks like volatility really increased during covid, and now going back down. Need to be careful with forecast putting weight on much recent data because it seems heavily influenced by covid...


```{r}
data_elec %>% autoplot(Germany) + 
  ggtitle("Exports from Switzerland to Germany") +
  ylab("GWt") + xlab("Month")
```



```{r}
#Investigating Austria closely since 2018, because it seems like something changed -> perhaps should use Piecewise!!!
Germany_since_2015 <- data_elec %>% select(Date,Germany) %>% filter(Date >= as.Date("2015-01-01"))
autoplot(Austria_since_2015)

#Modelling ets automatically
ets_germany <- data_elec %>%
  select(Germany) %>%
  model(ETS(Germany))

#Getting the Accuracy scores for models
report(ets_germany)

#Forecasting using the models
forecast_ets_germany<- ets_germany %>% forecast(h = 13)

#Graphing the forecast
ets_germany %>% forecast(h = 13) %>% autoplot(Germany_since_2015)+
  labs(title = "ETS MAdM Forecast for Germany")

#Extracting the forecasted values
forecast_values_ets_germany <- forecast_ets_germany$mean


forecast_table_germany <- data.frame(Model = c("ETS (MAdM)"),
                              Forecast_Values = c(forecast_ets_germany))

forecast_table_germany <- forecast_table_germany %>% select(Forecast_Values..mean)

colnames(forecast_table_germany)[1] <- "Germany_ets_MAdM"


#components(ets_austria) %>% autoplot()
```
