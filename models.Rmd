## Models


# Autocorrelation

Before moving on with the models and in order to be able to use them, we must check for autocorrelation in the time series. 

```{r}

#Let's look at Germany first

#Getting the acf for 12 lagged months
data_elec %>% 
  ACF(Germany, lag_max = 12)

#Graph of 9 lagged months
data_elec %>% 
  gg_lag(Germany, lags = 1:12, geom="point")
```

From the first table produced, we can see that the autocorrelation is highest with a lag of 1 month, and then it again goes up as we approach the 12-month lag. This shows that our data is highly correlated on a monthly basis (every month's exports heavily depend on the previous month's exports) and we can also see a slight "seasonality" of 12 months, because every 12 months the data is highly correlated (January of this year is very similar to January of last year)

From the graph produced, we can again see the same thing, but visualized.
